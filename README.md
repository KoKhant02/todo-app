- Responsive design that works well on both desktop and mobile devices
- Backend with RESTful API to manage tasks
- Frontend with modern, user-friendly UI

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, Vite, Axios
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, MongoDB
- **Containerization**: Docker, Docker Compose
- **Environment Variables**: `VITE_API_URL` for backend API URL

## Prerequisites

Before begin, ensure developer have the following installed:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) (via Docker container)

## Installation

To get started with the project:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KoKhant02/todo-app.git
   cd todo-app
   ```

2. Build and run the app using Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

3. The application will be available at:
   - Frontend: `http://localhost:5173`
   - Backend: `http://localhost:5000`

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory to configure the MongoDB connection:

```env

- To delete a task, click the ‚ùå button next to the task.

## Docker Setup

This project is containerized using Docker. Docker Compose is used to define and run multi-container Docker applications.

- The `mongodb` container runs MongoDB.
- The `node-backend` container runs the backend API using Express and MongoDB.
- The `react-frontend` container serves the React app.

### Docker Compose Commands

- Build and run the containers:
  ```bash
  docker-compose up --build
  ```

- Stop the containers:
  ```bash
  docker-compose down
